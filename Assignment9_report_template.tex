\section{Introduction}

Write introduction for the report.

\section{Initial Data Overview}

\subsection{Nile Dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dataset \texttt{Nile} is loaded in R.
    \item The dataset contains \_\_ years of data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AirPassengers Dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dataset \texttt{AirPassengers} is loaded in R.
    \item The dataset contains \_\_ numbers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary Statistics for the Nile Dataset}

For the annual flow of the Nile River, the following summary statistics are computed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean: \_\_
    \item Variance: \_\_
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normality Check}

A QQ plot is generated with a reference line:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{qqplot_nile.png} % Update with correct filename
    \caption{QQ Plot for the Nile dataset.}
    \label{fig:qqplot_nile}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Conclusion:} \textit{Is the data approximately normal? Justify your answer.}

\section{Two-Sided Hypothesis Test (Known Variance, Without t.test())}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Null Hypothesis: \_
    \item Alternative Hypothesis: \_
    \item Given true variance: 28350
    \item Significance level: \(\alpha = 0.05\)
    \item Z-value for two sided test from \texttt{qnorm()} lookup: \_\_
    \item Computed the upper and lower rejection values: \_\_
    \item Computed Z-statistic: \_\_
    \item Decision: Reject/Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis
    \item Type II Error (if true mean is 917): \_\_
\end{itemize}

\section{Two-Sided Hypothesis Test (Known Variance, Using t.test())}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis Test conducted using \texttt{t.test()}.
    \item Decision: Reject/Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis
    \item Consistency with previous test: Yes/No
\end{itemize}

\section{One-Sided Hypothesis Test (Unknown Variance, AirPassengers Dataset)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Null Hypothesis: \_
    \item Alternative Hypothesis: \_
    \item Data subset includes only the year 1955.
    \item Sample Mean: \_\_
    \item Sample Standard Deviation: \_\_
    \item Lookup t-value from \texttt{qt()} function: \_\_
    \item Significance level: \(\alpha = 0.05\), Sample Size \(n\): \_\_
    \item Computed test statistic: \_\_
    \item P-value: \_\_
    \item Decision: Reject/Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
