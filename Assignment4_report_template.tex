\textbf{*Throughout the lab report template, there are some notes in bold that are marked out with a *. These are reminders about things to include and/or specific notes for the assignment. You should remove these notes placeholders as you complete the tasks so you are left only with the final report content.*}

\textbf{*Before submitting your final report, read through all of your work to make sure your explanations are clear. Adjust page breaks as necessary so that you donâ€™t have tables split across multiple pages.*}

\section*{Books Data Overview}
There are \_\_ rows and \_\_ columns in the books dataset. There are \_\_\_ unique authors in this dataset.

The column headers are: 


\section*{Summary of Average Rating for Books Over 45 Pages Long that are in English}

\subsection*{Summary Statistics}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Statistic} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Number of books $>$ 45 pages & \_\_\_ \\
    Number of English books $>$ 45 pages & \_\_\_ \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{For English Books $>$ 45 Pages}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Statistic} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Minimum Value & \_\_ \\

\subsection*{Correlation Analysis}
The correlation between the average rating and the number of pages for books written in English that are more than 45 pages long is \_\_\_\_. \\ 

{This correlation value tells us that:} \_\_\_\_.

\section*{Visual Summaries of the Books Data (Books > 45 Pages and in English)}

\textbf{*For each of the following plots, make sure that your plots have axis labels and a chart title. Write a 1-2 sentence summary of your observations about the shape of the distribution and why these plots are not particularly useful/could be improved.*}

\subsection*{Five-Number Summary of the Number of Pages}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Statistic} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Minimum Value & \_\_ \\
    First Quartile (Q1) & \_\_ \\
    Median & \_\_ \\
    Third Quartile (Q3) & \_\_ \\
    Maximum Value & \_\_ \\

{Boxplot of the number of pages}

\section*{Choosing a Percentile}
\subsection*{Percentile Values}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Percentile} & \textbf{Number of Pages} \\
    \midrule
    95 & \_\_ \\
    96 & \_\_ \\
    97 & \_\_ \\
    98 & \_\_ \\
    99 & \_\_ \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\textbf{*For each of the following plots, make sure that your plots have axis labels and a chart title. You may create each plot in its own frame or you can put them all in one frame.*}\\

{Histograms of the number of pages when only the first P\% of page lengths are included, where P is 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.}

\subsection*{Chosen Percentile}
I have chosen the \_\_ percentile for the remainder of the lab for the following reasons:

\_\_\_\_..

\subsection*{Boxplot and Histogram}
\textbf{Boxplot and histogram of the number of pages when only the selected P\% of the number of pages data is included.}

\section*{Five-Number Summary of the Number of Pages Using the First \_\_ Percent of the Data}
\begin{tabular}{l l}

    \textbf{Statistic} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Minimum Value & \_\_ \\
    First Quartile (Q1) & \_\_ \\

{There are some differences between this summary and the one for all English books with at least 45 pages. The most important differences are:} 

\underline{(to be filled in)}.\\

\textbf{*Include a short explanation of what has and has not changed about the summary, and why these changes are important or acceptable to be able to generate easier-to-read graphs.*}

\section*{QQ Plot}
{QQ Plot of the Average Rating of the books that have more than 45 pages and are written in English with a reference line.}\\

{Based on this plot, we can conclude that the average book rating is not normally distributed because:} \underline{(to be filled in)}.
