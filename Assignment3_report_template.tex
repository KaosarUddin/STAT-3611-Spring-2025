\textbf{*Throughout the lab report template, there are some notes in bold that are marked out with a *. These are reminders about things to include and/or specific notes for the assignment. You should remove these notes placeholders as you complete the tasks so you are left only with the final report content.*}

\textbf{*Before submitting your final report, read through all of your work to make sure your explanations are clear. Adjust page breaks as necessary so that you donâ€™t have tables split across multiple pages.*}

\section*{Quakes Data Overview}
There are \_\_ rows and \_\_ columns in the Quakes data set. The column headers are: 

\section*{Summarizing the Magnitude of the Recorded Earthquakes}

\section*{Visual Summaries of the Quakes Data}
\textbf{*For each of the following plots, make sure that your plots have axis labels and a chart title. Write a 1-2 sentence summary of your observations about the shape of the distribution.*}

\subsection*{Histogram of the depths recorded for all of the earthquakes}

\subsection*{Boxplot for the number of stations that recorded data for each earthquake}
\textbf{[Insert Boxplot Here]}

\section*{Data Subset Numeric and Visual Summaries}
There were \_\_ earthquakes that were recorded by fewer than 40 stations and \_\_ earthquakes that were recorded by at least 40 stations.

\textbf{*After filling in the table below, write 1-2 sentences about any key takeaways you have about these different datasets based on their numeric summaries.*}

\textbf{*For each of the following plots, make sure that your plots have axis labels and a chart title. Write a 1-2 sentence summary of your observations about the shape of each distribution. Write a 1-2 sentence summary comparing the distributions of the different subsets presented in pairs. For the boxplots, explain your choice of the axes and the benefit of using the same axes for side-by-side plots.*}
